# Firebase Functions Project

This project is built using Firebase Cloud Functions to handle backend logic for your application. Below are the steps for setting up, deploying, and testing your Firebase Cloud Functions.

---

## **Setup**

1. **Install Firebase CLI**  
   To install the Firebase CLI globally on your machine, run:

    ```bash
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    ```

2. **Keep Firebase SDK Updated**  
   Itâ€™s important to ensure your project uses the latest Firebase SDKs. Run these commands inside the `functions` folder:

    ```bash
    npm install firebase-functions@latest firebase-admin@latest --save
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    ```

3. **Login to Firebase**  
   Login to Firebase using your Google account:

    ```bash
    firebase login
    ```

4. **Initialize Firebase Functions**  
   If Firebase has not been initialized in your project, run:
    ```bash
    firebase init functions
    ```

---

## **Deploy Functions**

To deploy your Cloud Functions, use the following command:

```bash
npx firebase deploy --only functions
```

---

## **Local Testing**

Firebase provides the Local Emulator Suite to test your functions locally.

1. **Start the Emulator**  
   Run the following command to start the emulator:

    ```bash
    firebase emulators:start
    ```

2. **Access the Emulator UI**  
   Open the Emulator Suite UI in your browser. By default, it will run on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

3. **Test an HTTP Function**  
   Use the URL provided by the emulator to test your HTTP functions. For example:

    ```
    http://localhost:5001/MY_PROJECT/us-central1/addMessage?text=uppercaseme
    ```

    Replace `MY_PROJECT` with your Firebase project ID and `uppercaseme` with your custom message.

4. **View Logs**  
   In the Emulator Suite UI, check the **Logs** tab to see the function execution logs:

    ```
    i functions: Beginning execution of "addMessage"
    i functions: Beginning execution of "makeUppercase"
    ```

5. **Check Firestore Changes**  
   If your function interacts with Firestore, verify the changes in the **Firestore** tab of the Emulator Suite UI.
